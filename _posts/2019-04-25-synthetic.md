## Background

Situational awareness for an autonomous vehicle (e.g., autonomous ship) depends on sensors that can perceive obstacles and other vehicles, 
and track and predict their motion so that collisions are avoided. The first step in this processing pipeline is to detect other vehicles in the raw sensor images. 
For cameras this is typically done by means of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Several recent MSc thesis associated with Autosea project have explored CNN-based ship detection (Tangstad2017, Grini2019). 

Since CNNs use machine learning, it is important to have enough training data. The data should support extrapolation to all ralevent scenes that one may encounter. 



## Scope

Bla bla

## Proposed Tasks for the 5th year project

the 5th year project will focus on automatic simulation of camera data in a maritime environment. It is also a goal to explore whether augmenting real data with simulated data can improve training of CNNs for visual vessel detection. 

The following tasks are proposed for the specialization project:

* Bla bla
* Write report. 


## Proposed Tasks for the MSc thesis

In the MSc thesis the main goal will be to investigate the role played by attitude in the simulation-based detection.
