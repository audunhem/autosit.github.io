title: The PMBM filter 4 - Graphical model techniques
category: SF
---
## Background

The Poisson Multi-Bernoulli Mixture (PMBM) filter is a gold standard for multi-target tracking. It is a sophisticated variation of Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT), where the probabilities of all sufficiently plausible data association hypotheses are calculated. 
For each of the data association hypotheses in the prior distribution, there will be several new association hypotheses in the posterior distribution. This differs from tracking methods such as Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) where the data association hypotheses are combined after every estimation cycle in order to mitigate complexity. 

 This leads to an exponential growth in the number of hypotheses, which typically is mitigated by pruning low-probability hypotheses. 
 Unfortunately, it will inevitably happen sooner or later that the true hypothesis is among those that are pruned. To mitigate the impact of this it is desirable to maintain individual track components, even if they fail to be supported by any hypothesis. To achieve this, we have to calculate the marginal probability that a given track component corresponds to a real target. 

In the context of the JPDA, techniques have been developed for calculating such marginal probabilities without explicit hypothesis enumeration. It is possible to evaluate these exactly by formulating the problem as marginalisation in a factor graph. A more popular alternative is Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP), which also builds upon a factor graph formulation, but is more straightforward to implement due to its approximative nature.

## Scope

The purpose of this project is to investigate whether exact and approximative factor graph techniques (e.g., Bayes tree and LBP) can be used to calculate marginal association probabilities in MHT/PMBM. The main challenge, and difference from the use of similar techniques in JPDA, is that the solution now must include marginalisation over several prior association hypotheses, instead of just a single prior association hypothesis.

## Proposed Tasks for the 5th year project

The following tasks are proposed for the specialisation project: 

* Bla bla. 
* Bla bla
* Bla bla
* Bla bla 
* Bla bla
* Bla bla
* Write report.

## Proposed Tasks for the master thesis

In the MSc thesis the work should move from toy scenarios to more comprehensive simulations and real data. It is also desirable to strengthen the theoretical foundations of the work using the tools of random finite set theory such as functional derivatives. The following topics are expected to be of central importance. 

* Study mixture reduction techniques to limit the number of hypotheses. 
* Benchmark against other approaches to AIS-radar fusion, such as Liland (2017) or Habtemariam (2014).
* Generate more elaborate simulations and/or participate in field experiments to record real data. 

This project can be expanded into a PhD or integrated PhD for a candidate with sufficient skills, background knowledge and motivation.

## Prerequisites
This is a challenging project that goes to the core of modern theory in sensor fusion. The following recommendations should therefore be considered. 

- Experience with sensor fusion or radar systems from internships or voluntary activities will be useful.
- It will be very useful to have had significant exposure to statistics and estimation from courses beyond ITK, e.g., from IES or IMF at NTNU, or from exchange studies. 
- It will be useful to take the course TTK4250 Sensor Fusion in parallell with the specialization project, instead of the conventional 2.75 SP modules. 
- The candidate must like mathematics and to analyze problems on a very detailed level.
