title: Sensor fusion for ReVolt
category: SF
---
## Background
The ReVolt is an unmanned and zero-emission ship concept designed for short sea shipping along the coast of Norway. The ReVolt was designed for low energy demand and the propulsion system is fully electric. The ReVolt has 2 stern pods and 1 retractable azimuth thruster in the bow.
A 1:20 scale model of the ReVolt has been built to explore and demonstrate the vessels autonomous capabilities and to test other design features.

During the spring 2019 ReVolt has been equipped with a 360 degree camera system and a lidar, enabling it to perceive its surroundings. 
An MSc student is currently working on the development of a real time detection and tracking system on ReVolt. 
This system will use convolutional neural networks for camera detection, clustering algorithms for lidar segmentation, and a multi-sensor version of the target tracking system described in (Wilthil 2017).
