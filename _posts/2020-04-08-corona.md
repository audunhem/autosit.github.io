## Background

Very much is at stake in policymaking during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The dilemma faced by politicians is this: Failure to control the spread of the virus may cause severe overload in the health system and cause thousands of deaths, while on the other hand the control measures may cause an unprecedented economic depression. Different strategies have been used by different countries. At the time of writing, it remains to see which country has chosen the best strategy. 

At the core of this is a problem of state estimation in a complex dynamic system with significant time delays limited observability and several unknown parameters. If a country is to pursue any more refined strategy than absolute suppression or laissez-faire, then the infection control measures must be adapted to the situation at hand, based on estimates of the number of infections, infection rates, case fatality ratio etc. 

Models of different levels of fidelity have been used in attempts to understand and predict the spread of the coronavirus. Other researchers have focused on estimating key parameters such as the reproduction number and the case fatality ratio. Estimating these parameters has been difficult, because the researchers have had to use non-representative sample populations (e.g., the predominantly old population onboard Diamond Princess). 


## Scope

The goal of this assignment is to develop closed-loop simulations of the infectious disease problem, including both simulation of the virus spread itself, the state- and parameter estimation needed for situational awareness, and infection control measures. 
While these results probably will come too late to be of much use in the current fight against SARS-Cov-19, the framework can be useful in preparing against future pandemics caused by slightly different viruses, and in assessing the robustness of the different infection control strategies. 

## Proposed Tasks for the 5th year project

In the specialization project the main focus will be on mastering the fundamental building blocks of PMBM and radar-AIS fusion. The following tasks are proposed for the specialization project: 

* Make yourself familiar with multi-target tracking, random finite sets, MHT and PMBM. 
* Design simple toy scenarios that will enable careful analysis of the expected benefits of radar-AIS fusion. 
* Revise the hypothesis structure of the PMBM filter so that its hypotheses not only are able to account for associations between measurements in consecutive radar scans, but also associations between these and AIS tracks. 
* Revise the expressions for the probabilities of the association hypotheses according to the revision of the hypothesis structure. 
* Revise the estimation of target kinematics according to the two data sources.
* Test the revisions in simulations. 
* Write report.

## Proposed Tasks for the master thesis

In the MSc thesis the work should move from toy scenarios to more comprehensive simulations and real data. It is also desirable to strengthen the theoretical foundations of the work using the tools of random finite set theory such as functional derivatives. The following topics are expected to be of central importance. 

* Study mixture reduction techniques to limit the number of hypotheses. 
* Benchmark against other approaches to AIS-radar fusion, such as Liland (2017) or Habtemariam (2014).
* Generate more elaborate simulations and/or participate in field experiments to record real data. 

This project can be expanded into a PhD or integrated PhD for a candidate with sufficient skills, background knowledge and motivation.

## Prerequisites

- The courses TTK4250 Sensor Fusion and TTK4220 Dynamics in Social Systems will both be very useful.
