## Background

Researchers at NTNU are in collaboration with [Zeabus AS] 
developing an autonomous pedestrian ferry whose purpose is to cross the Trondheim City Canal. 
Having a good understanding of the traffic patterns in the canal will make it easier for the ferry to interact smoothly with other boats in the canal. 
It is therefore a goal to be able to conduct realistic simulations of all kinds of traffic scenarios that are likely to find place in the canal. 

To achieve this, it is necessary both to register what happens in the canal, to comprehend what happens in the canal, and to generate and simulate  scenarios based on this. This problem involves both sensor fusion, statistical data analysis, automatic control and behaviour modeling. Consequently, this project builds upon several threads in research and MSc projects at ITK. 


* A [Unity-based simulator] for the autonomous ferry prototype MilliAmpere was developed as part of the EiT village Autoferge during Spring 2018. This simulator is currently being further developed by the MSc student Kjetil Vasstein at ITK. 
* Three previous MSc students, [Simen Hexeberg], [Bjørnar Dalsnes] and [David Wu], have developed methods for long-term prediction of vessel trajectories. These methods analyze patterns in historical data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), and attempts to guess the motion of a ship by comparing its current position and velocity with these patterns. 
* Two MSc students at ITK, [Jesper Pedersen] and Rolf Klæboe, have worked on automatic harbor surveillance for this purpose. To support these projects a sensor station with a radar and a camera has been mounted on the Brattøra side of the canal. 
* The [Autosea project] have developed several collision avoidance methods for autonomous surface vessels. Such techniques will necessarily have to be part of a realistic digital twin of the harbor environment.

## Scope

The overall goal of this project is to enable realistic simulations of traffic in the harbour environment. The results will be integrated in the aforementioned MilliAmpere simulator. It is important to understand that this is just a part of the simulator (other parts being, e.g., sensor modeling), but it is a very important part. The project is intended for a single student, but can also be solved as a collaboration of two or more students. 



## Proposed Tasks for the 5th year project

The main goal of the specialization project is to make sure that we have a good analysis of data from the canal. To have an optimal starting point for the specialization project, the candidate may record additional data during the summer (when the canal is at its busiest) in collaboration with other final year students and PhD candidates working on situational awareness for the autonomous ferry. 

* Data consolidation: What are the available data and simulation tools at the beginning of the project? 
* Literature study: What are available techniques for estimating behaviour models for maritime traffic?
* Run detection and tracking methods on available camera and radar data. Most of this machinery will be available from previous projects, but it is important to become familiar with the framework, and also to perform quality checks on the output. 
* Train a long-term prediction method with the results from the tracking system. 
* Validate the long-term prediction method with results from the tracking system. 
* Write report.

## Proposed Tasks for the master thesis

In the master thesis the candidate is expected to make several additional strides towards the overall goal of realistic traffic simulations. The scope involves some fundamental tasks that must be accomplished, and several open-ended research questions. 

* Include vessel types (kayak, motorboat, tourist ferry, etc.) as part of the prediction scheme.
* Include shore constraints and traffic rules (also known as the "COLREGS") as part of the prediction scheme.
* Perform simulations based on the prediction method. Evaluate how realistic the simulations appear. To which extent should the predictions be data driven, and to which extent should they use models of motion control systems?
* Simulate interactions between different vessels in the canal. Here MPC-based collision avoidance methods such as those developed in the Autosea project will be a natural starting point. To which extent does the output from these resemble the behaviour of manned vessels? Can they be tuned to provide more human-like behaviour? 
* Can machine learning techniques give more realistic simulations? Should machine learning be used primarily to tune statistical and control-theoretic techniques, or should machine-learning be used in a more end-to-end type manner?

| Historical AIS data show many patterns for how ships tend to move. Can we establish similar patterns for a harbour area by means of radar and camera based tracking?  |
