title: Twin of the Trondheim City Canal
category: LTP
---
## Background

Researchers at NTNU are developing an autonomous pedestrian ferry whose purpose is to cross the Trondheim City Canal. 
Having a good understanding of the traffic patterns in the canal will make it easier for the ferry to interact smoothly with other boats in the canal. 
It is therefore a goal to be able to conduct realistic simulations of all kinds of traffic scenarios that are likely to find place in the canal. 

To achieve this, it is necessary both to register what happens in the canal, to comprehend what happens in the canal, and to generate and simulate  scenarios based on this. Thus, this problem involves both sensor fusion, statistical data analysis, automatic control and behaviour modeling.

| The fundamental problem of long-term prediction: Standard kinematic models yield very large uncertainties after a couple of minutes. One must guess the other vessel's intentions if more accurate predictions are desired. |

| Historical AIS data show many patterns for how ships tend to move. Understanding of these patterns can be used to plan trajectories so that dangerous situations are prevented from arising.  |
